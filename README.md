# tribology
Import, analyze, and plot data collected from tribometers.

This repo was ceated to work with data on articular cartilage mechanics collected from either a linear reciprocating tribometer or a pin on disk tribometer.  The tribometers were created by the Materials Tribology lab in the ME deparment at UD run by Dr. David Burris (http://research.me.udel.edu/~dlburris/) and are operated by students of Dr. Burris and Dr. Christopher Price (http://sites.udel.edu/pricegroup/) in BME as part of a collaboration to study cartilage mechanobiology (http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2016/october/cartilage-joint-function/, https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1635536).
